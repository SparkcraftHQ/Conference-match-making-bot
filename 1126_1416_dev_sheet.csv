us to explore alternative approaches and sparked a profound transformation in our lives.
This shift not only influenced our personal choices, such as our diet and living environment, but it also gradually reshaped my professional perspective.
Inspired by the lessons we learned and the positive changes we experienced, I reevaluated my approach to medicine, ultimately leading me to
establish a functional medicine practice.

Through this transformative journey, both my personal and professional life has been enriched. I am committed to sharing the invaluable knowledge

.......................................................................................When you realize you are at the center of the world you are living everyday, you can
intentionally take that power back to fully embrace your rightful freedom. This realization came to me with no grace my friends. In 2008, I was the
poster child of success. I had the beautiful family, the prestigious career as a Doctor and business owner, and all the things money could buy except
one � freedom. That reality hit its hardest when my precious two year old daughter was diagnosed with brain cancer. The cancer had spread all over
her spine and she was given a death sentence (she is now 16, a freshman in high school with an education of a 4th grader, because of the cancer
treatments and the hormones of a 16 year old girl:), AND THE GREATEST TEACHER OF ALL TIME..) . I stood as a broken man and held to God�s
love and strength.
Even with the devastation of the diagnosis, the life I had built gave me no mercy. I still had to show up. I had a family to provide for, bills to pay, and a
staff that counted on me for the security I had promised to them. I had to be there for my daughter and my days were riddled with hospital visits and
discussions with her Doctors, all while taking care of my 4 year old son. My picture perfect life enslaved me to it. Yes, I was a business owner so one
would think I had more freedom, but as most business owner�s learn quickly, you are the hub and driving force of your business. There was no buffer,
there was no break. This was the lowest point of my life.
I was an intrapreneur with an entrepreneur mindset. There had to be a way out, there had to be a better way of living and my situation forced me to
either sink or swim � and that was when I decided to come up for air and take my power back. The freedom I desired lay in the structure of my
systems, the people I included, and the strategies I created. Years later, my approach of Intentional Freedom has skyrocketed my business into record
heights and gifted me the freedom I so desperately desired to explore, grow, create, and truly live life. I am undefined by my occupation and am
defined by my freedom, what I love, and what I place as priority. Now I am here to share Intentional Freedom with you so you can do the same",,image28.jpg

snowmobiling, shooting, hiking, mountain biking, paddle boarding, off-roading, etc� the best part is enjoying these amazing activities while ""working""
and creating memories with my family and friends.
Life hasn�t always been this fun�I know pain and childhood trauma� suffered (like most entrepreneurs) from horrible ADD, OCD and dyslexia, dad
left me at 12, lost my brother at 26, blinded in my left eye at 26, horrible relationships, health issues, bad alcohol and food addiction, gained over
100lbs, business failures losing millions�.
Then I created lvn|kzn and LegacyMaker.co, wrote my first book ""Your Life Is Not Your Fault...Until It Is"" and life became fun and exciting...
I lost 104 lbs, developed amazing relationships and in the best mental and physical shape of my life.
My passion and super power is helping others discover and monetize their unique ability.
Time to have fun doing life and business together!
Let's go serve others!

Dr. Don Wood, PhD developed the TIPP method after spending years researching how Atmospheric Conditions� affect our minds and impact our
lives. He went back to school later in life to get his PhD in Clinical Counseling and psychology, to learn how to heal his daughter�s Crohn's Disease
and his wife�s autoimmune disease. �Teaching people to live with, manage and cope with daily stress doesn�t fix the problem. The solution comes from
understanding it�s source and providing a long-term permanent solution.� �Both my wife and daughter experienced childhood trauma and I saw how it
affected their life, including their health. They both had developed autoimmune disorders.� In his search for answers for them, Dr. Wood made the
connection between trauma and their health issues. In addition, he recognized the daily stress they lived with and the only solutions provided came
from medications. His experience with his family provided the determination required to develop a cutting edge neuroscience approach. A holistic
solution that provides immediate and long lasting relief. The TIPP program developed by Dr. Wood has benefited individuals all over the world. �I
wanted to create a solution that removed the stigma of trauma. Too many people are afraid to ask for help because of that stigma. That is why we
named the program around increasing performance levels. When you eliminate the effects of disturbing or traumatic events, which I refer to as their
Atmospheric Conditions� in a person�s life, their performance improves both personally and professionally.� The results have been impressive. Dr.
Wood has helped trauma survivors from the Boston Marathon bombing attack, the Las Vegas shooting, to highly successful executives and world
class athletes perform at their best.
Marko Cheseto, a double amputee marathon runner, broke the world record TWICE after completing TIPP. Chris Nikic worked with Dr. Wood and
made world news by becoming the first person with Downs Syndrome to complete an Ironman competition. The Inspired Performance Institute was
built on this simple phrase, �There�s nothing wrong with you, there�s nothing wrong with your mind.� During your lifetime some events and experiences
have created some glitches and error messages for your mind, and all you need is a reboot.
Dr. Wood has written two books about his research including the science about how our minds work and why we experience our own unique
perspective of the world. Both books, You Must Be Out of Your Mind and Emotional Concussions, are focused on how we can all make the desired
changes by allowing our mind to reset and reboot. He has spoken on these topics domestically and internationally. He has been a guest contributor on
Joe Polish�s �I Love Marketing,� he has been a speaker for Spartan Leadership, James Wedmore�s Innercircle, Shanda Sumpter�s MasterMind among
many other speaking engagements. A podcast guest favorite, Dr. Wood has appeared on over 100 podcasts and many times has been the top 20%

BIOGRAPHY
I am a functional medicine certified dentist who is passionate about reversing dental and chronic systemic diseases.
Being trained in functional medicine and equipped with advanced dental training, me and my team are able to support our patients unique health
needs with a compassionate and thorough approach.
We shift the traditional disease-centered focus of dental practices to a more patient-centered approach, addressing problems as close to their root
cause as possible, not merely treating symptoms and managing diseases.
We spend time with our patients, listening to their stories and looking at the interactions among genetic, physiological, environmental, and lifestyle
factors that can influence long-term dental health and complex, chronic disease.
We integrate the latest emerging research of the best medical and dental practices of conventional western medical with what is sometimes
considered�alternative� or �integrative�medicine, creating a focus on wellness.
We thoughtfully recommend botanical medicines, pharmaceutical drugs, supplements, movement, food, detoxification programs, therapeutic
bodywork, energy healing and various stress-management approaches to help ignite the healing process.
We bring the patient into the discovery process and tailor treatment to address the individual�s unique needs for better health and vitality.
We value building authentic relationships with our patients that are grounded in deep listening, respect, honesty, options and education",,

BIOGRAPHY
I am an entrepreneur, business developer and strategist, and my life has been a whirlwind professional journey, starting when I was 11 years old. As
the child of a single mom, I had a natural draw to entrepreneurship to help our family. Between juggling babysitting work, door to door sales and
helping everyone I met who needed a hand, it would be fair to say that I was blessed with learning the value of supportive relationships very early on in
life � the more you give the more fun you will have.
As a tech exec, board member, and professional speaker, I am constantly encouraging people to get more out of themselves and reach their full
potential. Some of my friends call me a CEO whisperer due to the number of business leaders who call me for ideas, advice both personal and
professional. All the while I have closed a few hundred million dollars in fundraising, products and services to some of the world�s largest enterprises. I
am also privileged to serve as a board member for some ground breaking tech companies like Software Automation (sewing machine robots- yes
robots really are going to take over some of the world), Optios.com (helping the world�s most elite performers unlock their brain�s exponential capacity
using proprietary neuroscience technology), Steady(income robo advisor for America's working class to help them reach their income potential) and
advertising school Miami Ad School. I am proud of the collaborative work with brilliant people that I am privileged to spend time with every day as we
harness our positive human energy towards making a positive impact on the world.
Previously, I served as the co-founder and CEO of IdeaString, delivering the world�s first social innovation and collaboration SaaS platform to reduce
costs and optimize business processes. Our customers included GE, Coca-Cola, and The Home Depot, and we sold the platform to GE in 2015. I was
a co-founder and Publisher of PINK Magazine, launching in June 2005 to wide acclaim and 1 million professional women readers. An editorial from
Forbes described it as �Fortune meets Oprah.� Every year our sold-out events across the nation featured America�s most influential women in business
on panels which I moderated. I sold PINK in 2010. I was also a co-founder of ZapMedia and InfoGraphix, two Atlanta-based tech companies that
transformed the digital large-format on-demand printing industry by delivering a high volume RIPs and garnered 80% market share globally.
I am incredibly blessed to be married for 22 years to a brilliant, supportive, loving Dutch guy I met in a hotel lobby in Barcelona. We are DINKS -
double income - no kids -- but we do have a fur baby named Apple who is a 21 pound Labradoodle. Remco (the dutchman) and I are learning to invest
in start ups especially where we can add value. He is a terrific operator and always has new ways of tackling problem solving and has very strong
people management capabilities. He just finished helping to turn around a boutique brand brewery from certain bankruptcy to multi-year profitability
and fast growth.

Dr. Eckel�s personal experience with his wife�s Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease led him on a deep dive into regenerative medicine. Through this, he
developed a brain regenerative program and a nasal spray that specifically targets neuroinflammation in the brain. He utilizes sound and laser
technology, regenerative medicine, mind-body techniques, and other procedures to correct the body�s control systems and protect the body�s energy.
He believes the future of medicine lies in frequency, and he�s leading the way in bringing bioenergetics mainstream.
Dr. Eckel has been featured on major networks like ABC, NBC, and FOX, and has reached over 150,000 people with his online brain regeneration and
bioenergetics summits. He�s also published a book, �Shake It Off: An Integrative Approach to Parkinson�s Solutions,� and served as the President of
the Board of Naturopathic Medical Examiners.
His approach includes detecting the body�s energy and systems, such as energy fields, brain scans, blood, mind-body, nutrition, and genetics. He then
corrects the body�s control systems using bio-information, brain frequency, ketamine-aided hypnotherapy, electro-acupuncture, exosomes, and stem
cells. Finally, he protects the body�s energy using light and magnetic devices, IVs, ozone, and hyperbarics.",,

BIOGRAPHY
Currently, a 42yo board-certified anesthesiologist living in Gilbert, AZ and married to my amAZing wife Doreen and father of 4yo son Jakob�. But let's
tell ya how I got here. I was born and raised in Connecticut. Couldn't stand the cold weather and left immediately after graduating from Avon High
School in 1999. I went to Lakeland, Florida and got a B.S. degree from Florida Southern College majoring in Marketing Management with minors in
Sociology and Communications. I played college baseball and had no clue what I wanted to do with my life until October 2002, when the following two
life changing events occurred TO me, but now I realize they happened FOR me. My dad, at 47yo, drowned and then two weeks later my appendix
ruptured and I was in the hospital for a week and almost died. On 10/27/2002 as I was watching Game 7 of the World Series (Angels vs Giants) that
night I had an epiphany. I decided I wanted to become a doctor. I thought I was hallucinating but when I woke up the next morning I still wanted to
become a doctor. It took me 5 years and 3 attempts to get into medical school but I wasn't taking no for an answer. In the interim, I worked as an EMT
and pharmacy technician, putting myself in emergency situations and learning the vast array of medications that I would one day need to be familiar
with.
From 2007-2011, I went to medical school at Midwestern University in Glendale, AZ and then completed my residency in anesthesiology at Michigan
State University in 2015. Once again, I hate the cold so I left Michigan and moved back to Arizona. I worked as a hospital based anesthesiologist at
Banner Baywood in Mesa from 2015-2019. In 2020, amidst the COVID pandemic, I made a career change, out of necessity, and co-founded
Advanced Wellness and Pain. Our mission is to provide compassionate care and support by leveraging psychedelic medicine as a catalyst to create
positive life-changing experiences. In short, I have found my ikigai.
I have joined Genius Network because it seems synchronistically right for my life right now. Ironically, I always say your Network determines your Net

BIOGRAPHY
After three decades of industrial company experience, John Dalton created Industrial Device Investments in 2017, to broaden investment in and
acquisition of industrial products companies. IDI now has four companies. Please visit us at www.idinvest.net.
Dalton serves as CEO and chair of Perceptics. Perceptics was acquired from Northrop Grumman in 2006, and formed the cornerstone of IDI. Dalton
was active in daily operations for 11 years, but now focuses on capital allocation and strategy. In 2019, Perceptics had a crisis that reshaped the
company, starting with cyber-attack and causing cancellation of contracts by Perceptics largest customer. We continue to forge the company for the
future.
Dalton also serves as chairman of Materials Research Furnaces, LLC, an IDI investment in 2018. MRF builds high temperature furnaces for ceramics,
electronic component and other part production. Dalton has focused on building the team and strengthening customer relationships and market focus,
and IDI has continued to invest strongly.
In 2019, IDI invested in Proton Power, Inc., and Dalton joined the board. PPI manufacturers environmental equipment and specialized materials
including graphene.
Lastly, Dalton serves as chair with Tread Corporation, a global leader in mining equipment manufacturing. Dalton & IDI were recruited by Tread�s
lender to help reinvigorate the brand, after previous upper management and ownership had been dysfunctional.
Previously, Mr. Dalton was with SouthPointe Ventures, a private equity fund in Atlanta, Georgia, acting as the fund's operating partner. Prior to
SouthPointe, he has seventeen years of operating experience, starting with Fortune 500 General Electric and Black & Decker, and including senior
leadership positions with smaller organizations focused on unique technologies within basic industries. He holds a BSME from Cornell and an MBA
degree from UNC.
Dalton is involved with a variety of community stewardship causes. In Atlanta, he was volunteer at MUST homeless ministries, and later served on the
board and had active involvement with Crossroads Community Ministries for homeless. Dalton founded the Perceptics Foundation in Knoxville in 2008,
which supports employees and families, where they give time and money to nonprofits, with a three times (3X) match. The Foundation, a Genius 10
Minute Talk topic, now serves all IDI companies, has had a significant impact in Tennessee, New Hampshire and now Virginia, and recently passed
$1.5 million in matching donations. Dalton and his wife Sandy live in Knoxville, and their five children are scattered about: Mark (26), Chris (24), Ari
(19), Connor (17) and Krystin (11). They are active attendees at Two Rivers Church.

I love where I went to college. I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from MIT as part of the graduating class of 1986. Does anyone remember 
Heathkit- That was my passion in High School and led to me getting that degree. While I may not have directly utilized my degree in my professional life, I 
consider myself fortunate to have been accepted into a prestigious institution that prioritized problem-solving skills over mere memorization for exams. Yes, I 
still open things today just to see how they are put together even though they claim there are �no user serviceable parts inside.� I applied that problem-solving 
skill to turning around a family plastic packaging business after my father passed away in 1993. The business was headed for certain bankruptcy at the time. I 
had my own way of describing its problems, but in general I think Clate Mask covered it best. (Look up his talk at the Genius Network offices entitled �From 
$10 Million to $100 Million: Three Big Lessons for Growing and Scaling Your Business�).
I knew I was not an operator, so I needed to hire one. I found someone to be COO that the business could grow into. He came off a non-compete from a 
$300M business with 13 facilities. When he joined us we were a troubled $45M business with only 4 locations. When I sold the business in 2008 for$500M (13 
years later) we had become a $300M business with 15 locations. Yet, the first-best move I made at the time was hiring a change agent for the short time in 
between when I fired the previous COO and hired the new COO. It prepared the foundation for the success that would be created for those 13 years ahead. 
The second-best move was a change in mindset from being an �owner� to an �investor�. Though those words did not change anything in the �real world� they 
allowed me to see the business in a different light. The third-best move I made was partnering with the right Private Equity firm in 2004. I was able to take 
some money off the table, beginning a slow shift to helping other entrepreneurs change the world. In those short four years until the sale of the business I was 
able to 10x the cash I kept in the business.
In 2015, I exited the plastic packaging industry entirely after selling a business in The Netherlands for 42M �. That business started with a small group of 
people in 1995 and unknowingly began a theme of partnering with awesome people trying to build great things.One of the most exciting rides was with Bron 
Media Corporation, which included Bron Studios, Bron Animation, Bron Digital, and others. From its humble start in 2011, it saw records set with the largest 
sale at a film festival (for BIRTH OF A NATION sold to Fox Searchlight), the largest television deal (for the untitled Aniston-Witherspoon drama sold to Apple), 
and highest grossing R-rated film JOKER taking in $1,074,251,311. To date, Bron has 32 Academy Award Nominations and 6 wins, including BOMBSHELL, 
ROMAN J. ISRAEL ESQ., FENCES, and JOKER. Then COVID-19 emerged, abruptly halting production and closing theaters. Then a market arose no longer 
valuing growth over profitability. Then a writer�s strike happened. 
All of this led to filing for creditor protection in 2023. The good news is that I see a tax holiday coming soon for myself! More seriously, the good news is that 
lack of debt and massive diversification still holds a world of opportunity for the future. Today I am invested in over 200 startups across many different sectors 
including Blockchain / Crypto, Aerospace, VR / AR, SaaS, Finance, Education, Real Estate, AI/ML, Payments, Hardware, Cleantech, Healthcare, Consumer, 
Productivity, and more. Some are direct and very focused investments, others are through SPVs leveraging other people as mentors and connectors. This 
does not include the Fund level investments I have made. In this area, I am grateful to have very long term relationships with Lux Capital, Whitebox Advisors, 
Elliott Associates, and others. I have been on the Innovation Board for the XPRIZE Foundation. Seeded money for what turned into the Global Learning 
XPRIZE. I was a member of TEC 100 which turned into Vistage. I am now an emeritus member of TIGER 21. I am currently a member of the 25k Group at 
Genius. I was SCUBA certified in 1978. Love roller coasters. Have a gun collection for a home range. I still maintain my Triploi membership and am certified to 
fly Level 2 High Powered Rockets.
In summary, if family business, succession, private equity, selling your business, managing a �family office�, finding a new life past your �career�, investing, 
exploring new technologies, or anything else above, is anything of interest to you, reach out. Let�s talk. I am known for being the one person in the room that is 
going to say something different from everyone else. If I can make your path shorter or give you a different perspective, that would be amazing. I am NOT 
looking for deal flow or any other longer term time commitments, so please be respectful of that fact.

BIOGRAPHY
I am a speaker, author, and coach for entrepreneurs and their spouses. I work closely with EO, YPO, EOS, and other entrepreneurial networks to
support their members and spouses/partners. My work is derived from observing so many entrepreneurs struggle in their personal relationship, then
going through my own divorce in 2012. I have a heart for both the entrepreneur and the partner because I've experienced being the more ambitious,
driven partner in my marriage. Then, in my subsequent relationship, karma caught up quickly when I found myself completely lost in the gravitational
pull of my partner and his business. My second book, Alpha and Omega will be released later this year.
I live in Chicago with my two sons, Will (15) and Luke (13). We've recently blended our family with my partner Joe and his daughter Faith (19). After 10
years of being a single mom, it's insanely righteous be in partnership again. I love our funky little family so much! My sons' busy sports schedule forces
me to keep my business ELF. This leaves us plenty of time to be at their games and work on their dream of opening a fishing charter boat when they
graduate high school- they're going straight for The Retirement Trick! ?

BIOGRAPHY
LEILA PARNIAN believes the most powerful thing she can do is to make people feel things without ever saying a word. That is her art. She creates to
bring light into spaces of darkness. With no formal training, Leila pushed herself to learn different styles of art from oil painting on canvas to spray
painting large scale murals. �I want to inspire aspiring artists to create a full-time position for themselves in this field. I also want to inspire those who
do not believe they are creative, to create!� With immigrant parents who encouraged her to study in the medical field, she pushed boundaries and
followed her passion, even when she was told she would never make it. Fast forward to today and she is living her dream. Her biggest advice is to
take someone saying no as a speedbump and not a stop sign. She embraces rejection.
Leila was born in Scottsdale, Arizona to architects Abdolhay and Parvaneh Parnian, received her undergraduate degree in Economics from Arizona
State University in 2006 and continued with a Masters in Urban Planning from Arizona State University graduating in 2009. At the time of her
graduation, due to the failed economic market, nobody was hiring in development so she went to help her family business, Parnian Furniture. She
worked her way up the company ladder and now is the Owner of Parnian. Leila moved her art studio into the old spray paint booth inside Parnian,
where the public can view her painting live while she is there. When she is not in the store, she is painting murals off site, she is currently working on
20 murals for Marriott Hotels. The showroom and her studio is open to the public Monday � Saturday from 10am � 6pm and Sundays from 12m � 5pm.
Leila hosts TheraPour � & PartyPour � classes in her studio a couple times a month. TheraPour � & PartyPour � kits are also available for purchase.
Information for classes can be found on the website and on her Instagram @leilaparnian
When Leila is not working on art, she is active at Parnian helping clients with Interior Design. She enjoys playing the piano, working out and making
comedic skits for social media. Fun fact about Leila � she is a 3 time All American Racquetball Player and won collegiate nationals in 200",,image173.jpg

income stopped as soon as he stopped working).
Escaping solo-economic dependency changed Mark�s life in so many positive ways that he decided to teach, coach, and mentor others to help them
achieve their financial goals.
Even though Mark invests a lot of his time helping others, he stays actively involved in running his land investing business and is dedicated to teaching

Max Hansen,"BIOGRAPHY
I have dedicated the last two decades of my life to providing the best hiring practices in leadership search and consulting. I was fortunate that my first
job after graduating with a Bachelor�s Degree from Northern Arizona in Business Administration was with the Fortune 50 Recruiting firm Allegis Group /
Aerotek. This experience provided me a solid foundation for understanding both best in class business systems and selection processes.
In January of 2002, I founded my first recruiting/search firm, Job Brokers, Inc. Together with my team, we went on to hire more than 30,000 people
across a wide swath of industries including engineering, manufacturing, education, healthcare, distribution, mining, finance, technology, and apparel.
We proudly grew our annual revenues in excess of $35 million and expanded into other divisions and brands. The most notable being Y Scouts in
2012.
Why Y Scouts- Somewhere along the line in 2010-2011, the traditional contingent hiring model wasn�t allowing me to help organizations solve the
deeper rooted issues they were facing around their hiring practices. My desire to help organizations with the root of their challenges, along with the
lack of meaning in my work, pushed me to create the first ever purpose-based leadership search firm. In 2015, I sold all my interests in three traditional
recruiting companies to more aggressively pursue building Y Scouts and Purposed-based Leadership Search.
I am incredibly proud to be part of the Purpose Movement and a founding member of the Y Scouts team. I love the personal development I benefit
from while working with Conscious Leaders. I enjoy helping them and their organizations continuously improve and succeed as high performing
cultures and teams. The root of our work goes deeper � towards individual purpose, building true relationships, relentless learning, love, and their
ultimate intersection.
The only sustainable business strategy is hiring the right leaders and team members. I find it fascinating that as our world gets more complex with
technological breakthroughs, the demand for great leaders and people is at an all-time high.

without their business. Our Playbook advisory process results in a 10x - 100x value ROI for every client.

prepared and ready to recognize and appreciate the extreme value they can and will have in their post
exit life. That�s priceless. Second, we provide Dream Exit Quarters - quarterly assistance and advice to
help entrepreneurs be accountable to the implementation of their Playbook plan, overcome hurdles, gain
confidence and stay on track. Third, we provide Dream Exit Liaison assistance to help entrepreneurs
through the due diligence and sale process. We believe that every successful entrepreneur deserves and
needs an advocate who�s sole focus in on them and on making sure that they achieve the Dream Exit
they want and deserve. Going through the due diligence process is stressful, lonely, and unpredictable.
We help our clients get prepared for what to expect, serve as a �safe� advisor - the one person they can
talk to and strategize with safely and without risk, and - most importantly - guide them through the tricky
and challenging process to getting the Dream Exit they deserve.

Dream Exit they deserve because I know that we can help them get ready, get educated, and get
prepared to know what they want while helping them level their playing field against the sophisticated
buyers they will likely be up against. I also want to connect with people who have audiences of
entrepreneurs who are curious, committed, coachable, and who recognize that Dream Exits don�t just
happen but are the result of early, intentional and professional preparation.
BIOGRAPHY
Hello GN. I�m very excited to be here and to learn from everyone I can. My short story is that I loved trucks from the time I was 4. In college, I got a job
driving a garbage truck and that led me to a waste management career. In 1992, I started my first waste (environmental services) company and - wow
that was a journey. I�ll spare you all the details (please ask if you�re interested) but we grew, expanded, maximized and sold this business in 2015 for a
lot (at least I thought it was a lot).

Rjon Robbins,"- I�ve GOT At How to Manage a Small Law Firm we manage nearly 500 solo & small law firms ranging
from under 250K to $60M In gross revenues to deliver exponential growth.
- That GIVES Helps Lawyers manage their business properly which creates exponential growth.
- That GETS More clients, more money, freedom, personal growth and a life beyond their wildest dreams.
- I want HELP Build connections and partnerships that can help us help more lawyers and expand the
reach of our programs and offerings
BIOGRAPHY
In 2016 How To MANAGE a Small Law Firm, the national outside managing partner services company that RJon Robins founded, was named by Inc.
Magazine, for the second year in a row, as one of the 5,000 fastest growing privately held companies in the Country. Fastest in the category of helping
solo and small law firm owners kick-butt and build better law firms (affording them more financial resources and freedom of time to help more clients
and have a better life).
But�in 2008 RJon Robins lost pretty much everything. Which is pretty ironic because for 8 years previous, he�d made quite a great name for himself
as one of the most trusted resources in the Country. Thousands of lawyers turned to him for help whenever they needed clarity about how to grow and
manage their solo and small law firms. RJon first achieved notoriety after struggling with his own solo law firm which he (rather naively) went into it
without a written business plan, without a written marketing plan, without written processes or procedures, without job descriptions for staff (who ate
him out of house & home), and no financial controls to see what was happening before it was too late.
The notoriety didn�t come from the failure of RJon�s law firm serving his financial, personal and/or professional hopes, dreams or aspirations. That
alone would have hardly distinguished him from about half a million other struggling solo lawyers from all walks of life, who tilt at windmills all day long
(without anyone to be managing partner), in every area of practice, all around the Country.
What brought the notoriety was a stroke of luck. RJon was in the right place at the right time and happened to say just the right thing, to just the right
person; leading to RJon learning how to turn his struggling law firm around. On the strength of that, he was recruited by The Florida Bar�s legendary
J.R. Phelps of the world-famous Law Office Management Assistance Service (LOMAS). RJon invested the next four years of his career learning from
the best (and from some of the worst) about what it takes to start, grow, save, salvage, and run a perfectly good law firm into the ground. He also
learned quite a bit about how to do things the right way and used these skills, experiences, and profound insights to help thousands of lawyers build
better law firms and lives. He helped some of them start and build highly-successful law firms that run like real businesses and helped others save,
salvage and avert total disaster when the long term effects of running their law firm like a noble hobby finally hit home with a big, loud �splotch�. As the
only lawyer in the history of The Florida Bar to serve as a full time Small Law Practice Management Advisor, RJon spent the years between 1999-2001
working with what The Florida Bar estimates was more than 9,000 solo and small law firm owners.
Nowadays when he�s not conducting CLE workshops around the Country on behalf of some of the biggest names in the legal industry (LexisNexis,
Microsoft, Law Pay, Ruby Receptionists and dozens and dozens and dozens of bar associations, but who�s counting), RJon is attending to his duties
as CEO of the leading provider of outside managing partner, outside COO, and outside CFO services exclusively for solo and small law firms
nationwide�or he�s out practicing what he preaches about letting your business give you a life instead of the other way around.
Oh yeah, and RJon is a Member of The Florida Bar, where he�s still authorized to appear before the Southern District Federal Court, as well as a
member of The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. RJon earned an interdisciplinary degree from The American University in Washington, DC
(Communications, Law, Economics & Government), he graduated from Nova Southeastern College of Law and he doesn�t eat ice cream every day but
when he does, he prefers butter pecan.

any money or skill my Mom who I lost 20 years ago had to do what it took to make ends meet and she became a married man's mistress. (I think this
is behind my love of education and training because of the options one has when they have skills and thinking behind finding solutions to problems
and challenges. I excelled in high school as an athlete and sold homes in the summer while holding down 2 other jobs, landscaping and golf shop
duties at the the Wigwam while practicing basketball in the summer leagues. I received a scholarship to University of AZ from the Evan's Foundation

whole life and owe my survival to those who were gracious enough to support me. especially my wife who without her I would have spun out of control
as I wasn't very grounded and wasn't actually committed to being a present father and husband during the first 20 years of our marriage. So, I am
extremely grateful for surviving and thriving in the world and am now seeking a way to live out the next stage of my life with elegance, ease, grace, and

BIOGRAPHY
I am a Mom to two incredible boys ages 14 and 17, an IFBB Fitness Pro, 3x Ms. Fitness Olympia and Arnold Classic Fitness International Champ.
Owner of Pro Physiques, the largest Personal Training Gym in the state of Arizona, Owner of The Pros Online Training, coaching athletes all over the
world, Owner of FEARless by Whitney Jones Fitness apparel line, Promoter/Owner of the NPC Whitney Jones Classic, NPC Arizona State
Championships & the NPC/IFBB Triple O Dynasty show which are all fitness competitions here in Arizona. I am also a show host for Olympia TV and
enjoy emceeing live sporting events.
I'm passionate about helping people identify and tap into their health and fitness goals and elevating them to succeed in all aspects of fitness from
nutrition, exercise, discipline, lifestyle modifications as well as coaching athletes who compete across the world. So many people need help
establishing a better quality of life for themselves, but having the proper tools and knowledge is the key element. I preach the importance of goal
setting, having a strategic plan and maintaining the right mindset in order to succeed.
I've learned a lot through my 12 years as a professional athlete that has helped elevate me in the sport as well as in my business endeavors. I
compete in the fitness division which means we are judged on our physiques as well as a two minute routine that is based on gymnastics, tumbling,
dance choreography, strength moves and my style of routines include breakdancing and Bboy tricks. My athletic career can be summarized as the
""Comeback Kid"" having broken almost every bone in my body, undergoing 18 surgeries in my life and winning my first World Championship title 9
month after breaking my neck and competing in that very competition with a torn ACL/MCL from an injury suffered weeks out from the event. I feel
there's always a way to accomplish something, but you have to be willing to navigate new paths when problems arise and think out of the box in order
to achieve what you're going after. Through so many experiences in my competitions as well as business ventures I have gained a great appreciation
for the things in life that we CAN do and I preach the mindset of ""You don't HAVE TO, you GET TO"" - My H2G2 motto. This simple flip in perception is
empowering and can change the course of your daily habits.
In my spare time I love hanging with my boys and doing anything outdoors or active. Snowboarding is my absolute favorite thing to do even though,
interestingly enough, I hate the cold. My secret to happiness is laughter and you can find me scrolling memes on the daily or hanging around funny
and happy people who bring good energy and positive vibes.
